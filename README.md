# *Crowd Sourcing of Data for Fight Against COVID-19*
This is the project idea I got in my mind when every people around me including me were trying find medical supplies in emergency like ambulance, oxygen cylinder, plasma or medicine like remdesivir. In this time, most of people were not able to find reliable resources so I got an Idea to gather information from people and give it to needy.

### Description
*The project is based on*
1. HTML 
2. CSS 
3. PHP 
4. MySQL.
5. Bootstrap
* _Using_ ___PHP and MySQL___ _we are handling all the user entered data._

### Flow
*Whenever any user accesses the site, he/she will have to enter details about themselves and after that they will be able to view, insert, update and remove records. Though the data will be there, its reliability still can't be determined but people also have to be responsible.
